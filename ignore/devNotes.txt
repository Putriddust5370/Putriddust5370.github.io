Some things to consider are copyrights? 
Not sure if you've got a watermark already, 
even less sure how you would stop people 
from just nabbing you stuff off the site. 
Especially if you want super high res for 
good monitors. 

I get the feeling this is gonna kinda be 
your baby, and like a foundation for business 
prospects and whatnot, so I'm practically 
just a code-monkey at this point. Ooga 
booga make look nice and work gud. 

I don't mind writing/tweaking the html and 
all that to get it just how you like it as 
far as functionalities (links to social media, 
easy interface for you to add/delete pics)
